FalconWorks SoftWare presents FWFetch a little utility designed to EASILY search and download ebooks and audiobooks
from #ebooks@IRCHighway or other types of files from !Trigger based file sharing channels in the IRC world.

To use, simply click File/Config and fill in your desired nickname or use the generated nickname, fill in your nickserv password 
if you have one (not required) and browse to the folder you want your newly downoladed file to go into. Save your configuration and exit to the 
main screen

Click Connect and give the program about an hour to collect all the file lists being offered.  They will start showing up in the panel to the
left of the screen.  After you have several lists you can start searching and downloading. When searching be a general with your search terms 
as you can. For example: "John Jacobs Franco Indian" is much better than "John Jacobs Third Treatise On The Franco Indian Conflict of 1847"
Once you find results you want, you can double click, Control Click for multiple selections of Shift Click for selection in a closed group
then click "Add Selected To Get List".  If you manually shut down the get list is saved then reloaded the next startup. 

As soon as there are entries in the get list, the program goes to work sending in the requests and saving them to your selected folder. 

This work is written entirely in Visual Basic Clasic (VB6), and published as FREEWARE
